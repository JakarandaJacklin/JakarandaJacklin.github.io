    <h2>Transliteral Transcript</h2>
    <p>Bear noises. Lots of wilderness. Oooh I think that was a river? Damn that bear just grabbed a fish! You can hear beause of the squealing that the fish just made. Anyways be carful of bears y'all. Unless they are gay bears then by all means head right towards them, heheh.</p>
