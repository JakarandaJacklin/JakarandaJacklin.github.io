            <h2>High Plains</h2>
            <p>Something about like my life before college. Also the map above is technically for the high plains so don't worry about the fact that I'm reusing it down here. It's all placeholders anyways, yeah?</p>
            <p>Oh also there are going to be links on the maps to each location for futher details. Or maybe those bring one to the specific projects hosted in "the stars." We still be deciding.</p>
